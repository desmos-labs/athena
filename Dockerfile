# To build the Athena image, just run:
# > docker build -t athena .
#
# In order to work properly, this Docker container needs to have a volume that:
# - as source points to a directory which contains a config.toml and firebase-config.toml files
# - as destination it points to the /home folder
#
# Simple usage with a mounted data directory (considering ~/.athena/config as the configuration folder):
# > docker run -it -v ~/.athena/config:/home athena athena parse config.toml firebase-config.json
#
# If you want to run this container as a daemon, you can do so by executing
# > docker run -td -v ~/.athena/config:/home --name athena athena
#
# Once you have done so, you can enter the container shell by executing
# > docker exec -it athena bash
#
# To exit the bash, just execute
# > exit
